# Speedgoat Utility

This add-on is not necessary anymore. Please install the **Speedgoat I/O Blockset** instead.

If you have not yet installed the **Speedgoat I/O Blockset**, then please download and install the
latest version from [speedgoat.com/login](speedgoat.com/login).

The Speedgoat I/O Blockset is necessary when connecting to a Speedgoat real-time target machine.
